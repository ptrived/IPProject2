Instructions to compile the code :
----------------------------------
1) Extract the src.zip folder which contains all the source files and the makefile.
2) Before running the make command make sure the Java is installed.
3) To compile the code run "make".

Instructions to run the program :
---------------------------------
1) Once the code is compiled, there will be Client.class and the Server.class files which are the Client and Server program.
2) To run the Server, enter "java Server" from the command line. You will be prompted with message "P2P-CI/1.0 system is up".
3) To run the Client enter "java Client" from the command line. It will ask you the following information :
   - Enter the upload port number(>1024) :
	Enter the port number the client will be using to upload any document and it should be greater than 1024.
   - Enter Server address
	Enter the server's IP Address
4) Once the above information is entered, you will get a message "Connected to server". 
5) After successful connection with the server, the following Menu will be displayed :

Menu:
(i)      ADD RFC <RFC Num> P2P-CI/1.0
(ii)     LOOKUP RFC <RFC Num> P2P-CI/1.0
(iii)    LIST ALL P2P-CI/1.0
(iv)     GET RFC <RFC Num> P2P-CI/1.0
(v)      END

6) Below are the details about each command 
- ADD RFC <RFC Num> P2P-CI/1.0 :
	Command to add the RFC to the server list. Enter the ADD command in the specified format.
	It will ask the following information :
	a) Title : <Enter RFC title>
	
	Response : Once the rfc is added to the Server, there will be response like :
	P2P-CI/1.0 200 OK
	RFC <RFCNum> <RFCTitle> <IP of Peer> <UploadPortNum>

- LOOKUP RFC <RFC Num> P2P-CI/1.0
	Command to lookup the RFC in the server list.
	It will ask the following information :
	a) Title : <Enter the RFC Title>

	Response : The result of the lookup will be printed. For Example :
	P2P-CI/1.0 200 OK
	RFC <RFCNum> <RFCTitle> <IP of Peer> <UploadPortNum>
	RFC <RFCNum> <RFCTitle> <IP of Peer> <UploadPortNum>
	RFC <RFCNum> <RFCTitle> <IP of Peer> <UploadPortNum>

- LIST ALL P2P-CI/1.0
	Command to list all rfc's from the server.
	Response : The result of the lookup will be printed. For Example :

	RFC <RFCNum> <RFCTitle> <IP of Peer> <UploadPortNum>
	RFC <RFCNum> <RFCTitle> <IP of Peer> <UploadPortNum>

- GET RFC <RFC Num> P2P-CI/1.0
	Command to get the RFC from the peer. So before running this command peer will have
	to do lookup for that RFC so that it knows from which peer he wants to download the
	RFC. The following information will be required :
	a) Host : <IP address> - Address of the peer from which it wants to download the RFC.
	b) Port : <Port Num> - Port Number of the peer from which you want to download the RFC.
	Once the connection is successful with the peer, a message "Peer Connected" will be displayed.

	Response : The response of the GET command will be in the following format :

Participants : Prashant Trivedi(Student Id: 200063230),Riwika Roychoudhury(Student ID: 200067986)

Instructions to compile the code :
----------------------------------
1) Extract the src.zip folder which contains all the source files and the makefile.
2) Before running the make command make sure the Java is installed.
3) To compile the code run "make".

Instructions to run the program :
---------------------------------
1) Once the code is compiled, there will be Client.class and the Server.class files which are the Client and Server program.
2) To run the Server, enter "java Server" from the command line. You will be prompted with message "P2P-CI/1.0 system is up".
3) To run the Client enter "java Client" from the command line. It will ask you the following information :
   - Enter the upload port number(>1024) :
	Enter the port number the client will be using to upload any document and it should be greater than 1024.
   - Enter Server address
	Enter the server's IP Address
4) Once the above information is entered, you will get a message "Connected to server". 
5) After successful connection with the server, the following Menu will be displayed :

Menu:
(i)      ADD RFC <RFC Num> P2P-CI/1.0
(ii)     LOOKUP RFC <RFC Num> P2P-CI/1.0
(iii)    LIST ALL P2P-CI/1.0
(iv)     GET RFC <RFC Num> P2P-CI/1.0
(v)      END

6) Below are the details about each command 
- ADD RFC <RFC Num> P2P-CI/1.0 :
	Command to add the RFC to the server list. Enter the ADD command in the specified format.
	It will ask the following information :
	a) Title : <Enter RFC title>
	
	Response : Once the rfc is added to the Server, there will be response like :
	P2P-CI/1.0 200 OK
	RFC <RFCNum> <RFCTitle> <IP of Peer> <UploadPortNum>

- LOOKUP RFC <RFC Num> P2P-CI/1.0
	Command to lookup the RFC in the server list.
	It will ask the following information :
	a) Title : <Enter the RFC Title>

	Response : The result of the lookup will be printed. For Example :
	P2P-CI/1.0 200 OK
	RFC <RFCNum> <RFCTitle> <IP of Peer> <UploadPortNum>
	RFC <RFCNum> <RFCTitle> <IP of Peer> <UploadPortNum>
	RFC <RFCNum> <RFCTitle> <IP of Peer> <UploadPortNum>

- LIST ALL P2P-CI/1.0
	Command to list all rfc's from the server.
	Response : The result of the lookup will be printed. For Example :

	RFC <RFCNum> <RFCTitle> <IP of Peer> <UploadPortNum>
	RFC <RFCNum> <RFCTitle> <IP of Peer> <UploadPortNum>
	RFC <RFCNum> <RFCTitle> <IP of Peer> <UploadPortNum>

- GET RFC <RFC Num> P2P-CI/1.0
	Command to get the RFC from the peer. So before running this command peer will have
	to do lookup for that RFC so that it knows from which peer he wants to download the
	RFC. The following information will be required :
	a) Host : <IP address> - Address of the peer from which it wants to download the RFC.
	b) Port : <Port Num> - Port Number of the peer from which you want to download the RFC.
	Once the connection is successful with the peer, a message "Peer Connected" will be displayed.

	Response : The response of the GET command will be in the following format :
	
	P2P-CI/1.0 200 OK

Instructions to compile the code :
----------------------------------
1) Extract the src.zip folder which contains all the source files and the makefile.
2) Before running the make command make sure the Java is installed.
3) To compile the code run "make".

Instructions to run the program :
---------------------------------
1) Once the code is compiled, there will be Client.class and the Server.class files which are the Client and Server program.
2) To run the Server, enter "java Server" from the command line. You will be prompted with message "P2P-CI/1.0 system is up".
3) To run the Client enter "java Client" from the command line. It will ask you the following information :
   - Enter the upload port number(>1024) :
	Enter the port number the client will be using to upload any document and it should be greater than 1024.
   - Enter Server address

Instructions to compile the code :
----------------------------------
1) Extract the src.zip folder which contains all the source files and the makefile.
2) Before running the make command make sure the Java is installed.
3) To compile the code run "make".

Instructions to run the program :
---------------------------------
1) Once the code is compiled, there will be Client.class and the Server.class files which are the Client and Server program.
2) To run the Server, enter "java Server" from the command line. You will be prompted with message "P2P-CI/1.0 system is up".
3) To run the Client enter "java Client" from the command line. It will ask you the following information :
   - Enter the upload port number(>1024) :
	Enter the port number the client will be using to upload any document and it should be greater than 1024.
   - Enter Server address
	Enter the server's IP Address
4) Once the above information is entered, you will get a message "Connected to server". 
5) After successful connection with the server, the following Menu will be displayed :

Menu:
(i)      ADD RFC <RFC Num> P2P-CI/1.0
(ii)     LOOKUP RFC <RFC Num> P2P-CI/1.0
(iii)    LIST ALL P2P-CI/1.0
(iv)     GET RFC <RFC Num> P2P-CI/1.0
(v)      END

6) Below are the details about each command 
- ADD RFC <RFC Num> P2P-CI/1.0 :
	Command to add the RFC to the server list. Enter the ADD command in the specified format.
	It will ask the following information :
	a) Title : <Enter RFC title>
	
	Response : Once the rfc is added to the Server, there will be response like :
	P2P-CI/1.0 200 OK
	RFC <RFCNum> <RFCTitle> <IP of Peer> <UploadPortNum>

- LOOKUP RFC <RFC Num> P2P-CI/1.0
	Command to lookup the RFC in the server list.
	It will ask the following information :
	a) Title : <Enter the RFC Title>

	Response : The result of the lookup will be printed. For Example :
	P2P-CI/1.0 200 OK
	RFC <RFCNum> <RFCTitle> <IP of Peer> <UploadPortNum>
	RFC <RFCNum> <RFCTitle> <IP of Peer> <UploadPortNum>
	RFC <RFCNum> <RFCTitle> <IP of Peer> <UploadPortNum>

- LIST ALL P2P-CI/1.0
	Command to list all rfc's from the server.
	Response : The result of the lookup will be printed. For Example :

	RFC <RFCNum> <RFCTitle> <IP of Peer> <UploadPortNum>

- GET RFC <RFC Num> P2P-CI/1.0
	Command to get the RFC from the peer. So before running this command peer will have
	to do lookup for that RFC so that it knows from which peer he wants to download the
	RFC. The following information will be required :
	a) Host : <IP address> - Address of the peer from which it wants to download the RFC.
	b) Port : <Port Num> - Port Number of the peer from which you want to download the RFC.
	Once the connection is successful with the peer, a message "Peer Connected" will be displayed.

	Response : The response of the GET command will be in the following format :

Participants : Prashant Trivedi(Student Id: 200063230),Riwika Roychoudhury(Student ID: 200067986)

Instructions to compile the code :
----------------------------------
1) Extract the src.zip folder which contains all the source files and the makefile.
2) Before running the make command make sure the Java is installed.
3) To compile the code run "make".

Instructions to run the program :
---------------------------------
1) Once the code is compiled, there will be Client.class and the Server.class files which are the Client and Server program.
2) To run the Server, enter "java Server" from the command line. You will be prompted with message "P2P-CI/1.0 system is up".
3) To run the Client enter "java Client" from the command line. It will ask you the following information :
   - Enter the upload port number(>1024) :
	Enter the port number the client will be using to upload any document and it should be greater than 1024.
   - Enter Server address
	Enter the server's IP Address
4) Once the above information is entered, you will get a message "Connected to server". 
5) After successful connection with the server, the following Menu will be displayed :

Menu:
(i)      ADD RFC <RFC Num> P2P-CI/1.0
(ii)     LOOKUP RFC <RFC Num> P2P-CI/1.0
(iii)    LIST ALL P2P-CI/1.0
(iv)     GET RFC <RFC Num> P2P-CI/1.0
(v)      END

6) Below are the details about each command 
- ADD RFC <RFC Num> P2P-CI/1.0 :
	Command to add the RFC to the server list. Enter the ADD command in the specified format.
	It will ask the following information :
	a) Title : <Enter RFC title>
	
	Response : Once the rfc is added to the Server, there will be response like :
	P2P-CI/1.0 200 OK
	RFC <RFCNum> <RFCTitle> <IP of Peer> <UploadPortNum>

- LOOKUP RFC <RFC Num> P2P-CI/1.0
	Command to lookup the RFC in the server list.
	It will ask the following information :
	a) Title : <Enter the RFC Title>

	Response : The result of the lookup will be printed. For Example :
	P2P-CI/1.0 200 OK
	RFC <RFCNum> <RFCTitle> <IP of Peer> <UploadPortNum>
	RFC <RFCNum> <RFCTitle> <IP of Peer> <UploadPortNum>
	RFC <RFCNum> <RFCTitle> <IP of Peer> <UploadPortNum>

- LIST ALL P2P-CI/1.0
	Command to list all rfc's from the server.
	Response : The result of the lookup will be printed. For Example :

	RFC <RFCNum> <RFCTitle> <IP of Peer> <UploadPortNum>
	RFC <RFCNum> <RFCTitle> <IP of Peer> <UploadPortNum>
	RFC <RFCNum> <RFCTitle> <IP of Peer> <UploadPortNum>

- GET RFC <RFC Num> P2P-CI/1.0
	Command to get the RFC from the peer. So before running this command peer will have
	to do lookup for that RFC so that it knows from which peer he wants to download the
	RFC. The following information will be required :
	a) Host : <IP address> - Address of the peer from which it wants to download the RFC.
	b) Port : <Port Num> - Port Number of the peer from which you want to download the RFC.
	Once the connection is successful with the peer, a message "Peer Connected" will be displayed.

	Response : The response of the GET command will be in the following format :
	
	P2P-CI/1.0 200 OK

Instructions to compile the code :
----------------------------------
1) Extract the src.zip folder which contains all the source files and the makefile.
2) Before running the make command make sure the Java is installed.
3) To compile the code run "make".

Instructions to run the program :
---------------------------------
1) Once the code is compiled, there will be Client.class and the Server.class files which are the Client and Server program.
2) To run the Server, enter "java Server" from the command line. You will be prompted with message "P2P-CI/1.0 system is up".
3) To run the Client enter "java Client" from the command line. It will ask you the following information :
   - Enter the upload port number(>1024) :
	Enter the port number the client will be using to upload any document and it should be greater than 1024.
   - Enter Server address

Instructions to compile the code :
----------------------------------
1) Extract the src.zip folder which contains all the source files and the makefile.
2) Before running the make command make sure the Java is installed.
3) To compile the code run "make".

Instructions to run the program :
---------------------------------
1) Once the code is compiled, there will be Client.class and the Server.class files which are the Client and Server program.
2) To run the Server, enter "java Server" from the command line. You will be prompted with message "P2P-CI/1.0 system is up".
3) To run the Client enter "java Client" from the command line. It will ask you the following information :
   - Enter the upload port number(>1024) :
	Enter the port number the client will be using to upload any document and it should be greater than 1024.
   - Enter Server address
	Enter the server's IP Address
4) Once the above information is entered, you will get a message "Connected to server". 
5) After successful connection with the server, the following Menu will be displayed :

Menu:
(i)      ADD RFC <RFC Num> P2P-CI/1.0
(ii)     LOOKUP RFC <RFC Num> P2P-CI/1.0
(iii)    LIST ALL P2P-CI/1.0
(iv)     GET RFC <RFC Num> P2P-CI/1.0
(v)      END

6) Below are the details about each command 
- ADD RFC <RFC Num> P2P-CI/1.0 :
	Command to add the RFC to the server list. Enter the ADD command in the specified format.
	It will ask the following information :
	a) Title : <Enter RFC title>
	
	Response : Once the rfc is added to the Server, there will be response like :
	P2P-CI/1.0 200 OK
	RFC <RFCNum> <RFCTitle> <IP of Peer> <UploadPortNum>

- LOOKUP RFC <RFC Num> P2P-CI/1.0
	Command to lookup the RFC in the server list.
	It will ask the following information :
	a) Title : <Enter the RFC Title>

	Response : The result of the lookup will be printed. For Example :
	P2P-CI/1.0 200 OK
	RFC <RFCNum> <RFCTitle> <IP of Peer> <UploadPortNum>
	RFC <RFCNum> <RFCTitle> <IP of Peer> <UploadPortNum>
	RFC <RFCNum> <RFCTitle> <IP of Peer> <UploadPortNum>

- LIST ALL P2P-CI/1.0
	Command to list all rfc's from the server.
	Response : The result of the lookup will be printed. For Example :

	RFC <RFCNum> <RFCTitle> <IP of Peer> <UploadPortNum>

- GET RFC <RFC Num> P2P-CI/1.0
	Command to get the RFC from the peer. So before running this command peer will have
	to do lookup for that RFC so that it knows from which peer he wants to download the
	RFC. The following information will be required :
	a) Host : <IP address> - Address of the peer from which it wants to download the RFC.
	b) Port : <Port Num> - Port Number of the peer from which you want to download the RFC.
	Once the connection is successful with the peer, a message "Peer Connected" will be displayed.

	Response : The response of the GET command will be in the following format :

Participants : Prashant Trivedi(Student Id: 200063230),Riwika Roychoudhury(Student ID: 200067986)

Instructions to compile the code :
----------------------------------
1) Extract the src.zip folder which contains all the source files and the makefile.
2) Before running the make command make sure the Java is installed.
3) To compile the code run "make".

Instructions to run the program :
---------------------------------
1) Once the code is compiled, there will be Client.class and the Server.class files which are the Client and Server program.
2) To run the Server, enter "java Server" from the command line. You will be prompted with message "P2P-CI/1.0 system is up".
3) To run the Client enter "java Client" from the command line. It will ask you the following information :
   - Enter the upload port number(>1024) :
	Enter the port number the client will be using to upload any document and it should be greater than 1024.
   - Enter Server address
	Enter the server's IP Address
4) Once the above information is entered, you will get a message "Connected to server". 
5) After successful connection with the server, the following Menu will be displayed :

Menu:
(i)      ADD RFC <RFC Num> P2P-CI/1.0
(ii)     LOOKUP RFC <RFC Num> P2P-CI/1.0
(iii)    LIST ALL P2P-CI/1.0
(iv)     GET RFC <RFC Num> P2P-CI/1.0
(v)      END

6) Below are the details about each command 
- ADD RFC <RFC Num> P2P-CI/1.0 :
	Command to add the RFC to the server list. Enter the ADD command in the specified format.
	It will ask the following information :
	a) Title : <Enter RFC title>
	
	Response : Once the rfc is added to the Server, there will be response like :
	P2P-CI/1.0 200 OK
	RFC <RFCNum> <RFCTitle> <IP of Peer> <UploadPortNum>

- LOOKUP RFC <RFC Num> P2P-CI/1.0
	Command to lookup the RFC in the server list.
	It will ask the following information :
	a) Title : <Enter the RFC Title>

	Response : The result of the lookup will be printed. For Example :
	P2P-CI/1.0 200 OK
	RFC <RFCNum> <RFCTitle> <IP of Peer> <UploadPortNum>
	RFC <RFCNum> <RFCTitle> <IP of Peer> <UploadPortNum>
	RFC <RFCNum> <RFCTitle> <IP of Peer> <UploadPortNum>

- LIST ALL P2P-CI/1.0
	Command to list all rfc's from the server.
	Response : The result of the lookup will be printed. For Example :

	RFC <RFCNum> <RFCTitle> <IP of Peer> <UploadPortNum>
	RFC <RFCNum> <RFCTitle> <IP of Peer> <UploadPortNum>
	RFC <RFCNum> <RFCTitle> <IP of Peer> <UploadPortNum>

- GET RFC <RFC Num> P2P-CI/1.0
	Command to get the RFC from the peer. So before running this command peer will have
	to do lookup for that RFC so that it knows from which peer he wants to download the
	RFC. The following information will be required :
	a) Host : <IP address> - Address of the peer from which it wants to download the RFC.
	b) Port : <Port Num> - Port Number of the peer from which you want to download the RFC.
	Once the connection is successful with the peer, a message "Peer Connected" will be displayed.

	Response : The response of the GET command will be in the following format :
	
	P2P-CI/1.0 200 OK

Instructions to compile the code :
----------------------------------
1) Extract the src.zip folder which contains all the source files and the makefile.
2) Before running the make command make sure the Java is installed.
3) To compile the code run "make".

Instructions to run the program :
---------------------------------
1) Once the code is compiled, there will be Client.class and the Server.class files which are the Client and Server program.
2) To run the Server, enter "java Server" from the command line. You will be prompted with message "P2P-CI/1.0 system is up".
3) To run the Client enter "java Client" from the command line. It will ask you the following information :
   - Enter the upload port number(>1024) :
	Enter the port number the client will be using to upload any document and it should be greater than 1024.
   - Enter Server address

Instructions to compile the code :
----------------------------------
1) Extract the src.zip folder which contains all the source files and the makefile.
2) Before running the make command make sure the Java is installed.
3) To compile the code run "make".

Instructions to run the program :
---------------------------------
1) Once the code is compiled, there will be Client.class and the Server.class files which are the Client and Server program.
2) To run the Server, enter "java Server" from the command line. You will be prompted with message "P2P-CI/1.0 system is up".
3) To run the Client enter "java Client" from the command line. It will ask you the following information :
   - Enter the upload port number(>1024) :
	Enter the port number the client will be using to upload any document and it should be greater than 1024.
   - Enter Server address
	Enter the server's IP Address
4) Once the above information is entered, you will get a message "Connected to server". 
5) After successful connection with the server, the following Menu will be displayed :

Menu:
(i)      ADD RFC <RFC Num> P2P-CI/1.0
(ii)     LOOKUP RFC <RFC Num> P2P-CI/1.0
(iii)    LIST ALL P2P-CI/1.0
(iv)     GET RFC <RFC Num> P2P-CI/1.0
(v)      END

6) Below are the details about each command 
- ADD RFC <RFC Num> P2P-CI/1.0 :
	Command to add the RFC to the server list. Enter the ADD command in the specified format.
	It will ask the following information :
	a) Title : <Enter RFC title>
	
	Response : Once the rfc is added to the Server, there will be response like :
	P2P-CI/1.0 200 OK
	RFC <RFCNum> <RFCTitle> <IP of Peer> <UploadPortNum>

- LOOKUP RFC <RFC Num> P2P-CI/1.0
	Command to lookup the RFC in the server list.
	It will ask the following information :
	a) Title : <Enter the RFC Title>

	Response : The result of the lookup will be printed. For Example :
	P2P-CI/1.0 200 OK
	RFC <RFCNum> <RFCTitle> <IP of Peer> <UploadPortNum>
	RFC <RFCNum> <RFCTitle> <IP of Peer> <UploadPortNum>
	RFC <RFCNum> <RFCTitle> <IP of Peer> <UploadPortNum>

- LIST ALL P2P-CI/1.0
	Command to list all rfc's from the server.
	Response : The result of the lookup will be printed. For Example :

	RFC <RFCNum> <RFCTitle> <IP of Peer> <UploadPortNum>

- GET RFC <RFC Num> P2P-CI/1.0
	Command to get the RFC from the peer. So before running this command peer will have
	to do lookup for that RFC so that it knows from which peer he wants to download the
	RFC. The following information will be required :
	a) Host : <IP address> - Address of the peer from which it wants to download the RFC.
	b) Port : <Port Num> - Port Number of the peer from which you want to download the RFC.
	Once the connection is successful with the peer, a message "Peer Connected" will be displayed.

	Response : The response of the GET command will be in the following format :

Participants : Prashant Trivedi(Student Id: 200063230),Riwika Roychoudhury(Student ID: 200067986)

Instructions to compile the code :
----------------------------------
1) Extract the src.zip folder which contains all the source files and the makefile.
2) Before running the make command make sure the Java is installed.
3) To compile the code run "make".

Instructions to run the program :
---------------------------------
1) Once the code is compiled, there will be Client.class and the Server.class files which are the Client and Server program.
2) To run the Server, enter "java Server" from the command line. You will be prompted with message "P2P-CI/1.0 system is up".
3) To run the Client enter "java Client" from the command line. It will ask you the following information :
   - Enter the upload port number(>1024) :
	Enter the port number the client will be using to upload any document and it should be greater than 1024.
   - Enter Server address
	Enter the server's IP Address
4) Once the above information is entered, you will get a message "Connected to server". 
5) After successful connection with the server, the following Menu will be displayed :

Menu:
(i)      ADD RFC <RFC Num> P2P-CI/1.0
(ii)     LOOKUP RFC <RFC Num> P2P-CI/1.0
(iii)    LIST ALL P2P-CI/1.0
(iv)     GET RFC <RFC Num> P2P-CI/1.0
(v)      END

6) Below are the details about each command 
- ADD RFC <RFC Num> P2P-CI/1.0 :
	Command to add the RFC to the server list. Enter the ADD command in the specified format.
	It will ask the following information :
	a) Title : <Enter RFC title>
	
	Response : Once the rfc is added to the Server, there will be response like :
	P2P-CI/1.0 200 OK
	RFC <RFCNum> <RFCTitle> <IP of Peer> <UploadPortNum>

- LOOKUP RFC <RFC Num> P2P-CI/1.0
	Command to lookup the RFC in the server list.
	It will ask the following information :
	a) Title : <Enter the RFC Title>

	Response : The result of the lookup will be printed. For Example :
	P2P-CI/1.0 200 OK
	RFC <RFCNum> <RFCTitle> <IP of Peer> <UploadPortNum>
	RFC <RFCNum> <RFCTitle> <IP of Peer> <UploadPortNum>
	RFC <RFCNum> <RFCTitle> <IP of Peer> <UploadPortNum>

- LIST ALL P2P-CI/1.0
	Command to list all rfc's from the server.
	Response : The result of the lookup will be printed. For Example :

	RFC <RFCNum> <RFCTitle> <IP of Peer> <UploadPortNum>
	RFC <RFCNum> <RFCTitle> <IP of Peer> <UploadPortNum>
	RFC <RFCNum> <RFCTitle> <IP of Peer> <UploadPortNum>

- GET RFC <RFC Num> P2P-CI/1.0
	Command to get the RFC from the peer. So before running this command peer will have
	to do lookup for that RFC so that it knows from which peer he wants to download the
	RFC. The following information will be required :
	a) Host : <IP address> - Address of the peer from which it wants to download the RFC.
	b) Port : <Port Num> - Port Number of the peer from which you want to download the RFC.
	Once the connection is successful with the peer, a message "Peer Connected" will be displayed.

	Response : The response of the GET command will be in the following format :
	
	P2P-CI/1.0 200 OK

Instructions to compile the code :
----------------------------------
1) Extract the src.zip folder which contains all the source files and the makefile.
2) Before running the make command make sure the Java is installed.
3) To compile the code run "make".

Instructions to run the program :
---------------------------------
1) Once the code is compiled, there will be Client.class and the Server.class files which are the Client and Server program.
2) To run the Server, enter "java Server" from the command line. You will be prompted with message "P2P-CI/1.0 system is up".
3) To run the Client enter "java Client" from the command line. It will ask you the following information :
   - Enter the upload port number(>1024) :
	Enter the port number the client will be using to upload any document and it should be greater than 1024.
   - Enter Server address

Instructions to compile the code :
----------------------------------
1) Extract the src.zip folder which contains all the source files and the makefile.
2) Before running the make command make sure the Java is installed.
3) To compile the code run "make".

Instructions to run the program :
---------------------------------
1) Once the code is compiled, there will be Client.class and the Server.class files which are the Client and Server program.
2) To run the Server, enter "java Server" from the command line. You will be prompted with message "P2P-CI/1.0 system is up".
3) To run the Client enter "java Client" from the command line. It will ask you the following information :
   - Enter the upload port number(>1024) :
	Enter the port number the client will be using to upload any document and it should be greater than 1024.
   - Enter Server address
	Enter the server's IP Address
4) Once the above information is entered, you will get a message "Connected to server". 
5) After successful connection with the server, the following Menu will be displayed :

Menu:
(i)      ADD RFC <RFC Num> P2P-CI/1.0
(ii)     LOOKUP RFC <RFC Num> P2P-CI/1.0
(iii)    LIST ALL P2P-CI/1.0
(iv)     GET RFC <RFC Num> P2P-CI/1.0
(v)      END

6) Below are the details about each command 
- ADD RFC <RFC Num> P2P-CI/1.0 :
	Command to add the RFC to the server list. Enter the ADD command in the specified format.
	It will ask the following information :
	a) Title : <Enter RFC title>
	
	Response : Once the rfc is added to the Server, there will be response like :
	P2P-CI/1.0 200 OK
	RFC <RFCNum> <RFCTitle> <IP of Peer> <UploadPortNum>

- LOOKUP RFC <RFC Num> P2P-CI/1.0
	Command to lookup the RFC in the server list.
	It will ask the following information :
	a) Title : <Enter the RFC Title>

	Response : The result of the lookup will be printed. For Example :
	P2P-CI/1.0 200 OK
	RFC <RFCNum> <RFCTitle> <IP of Peer> <UploadPortNum>
	RFC <RFCNum> <RFCTitle> <IP of Peer> <UploadPortNum>
	RFC <RFCNum> <RFCTitle> <IP of Peer> <UploadPortNum>

- LIST ALL P2P-CI/1.0
	Command to list all rfc's from the server.
	Response : The result of the lookup will be printed. For Example :

	RFC <RFCNum> <RFCTitle> <IP of Peer> <UploadPortNum>

- GET RFC <RFC Num> P2P-CI/1.0
	Command to get the RFC from the peer. So before running this command peer will have
	to do lookup for that RFC so that it knows from which peer he wants to download the
	RFC. The following information will be required :
	a) Host : <IP address> - Address of the peer from which it wants to download the RFC.
	b) Port : <Port Num> - Port Number of the peer from which you want to download the RFC.
	Once the connection is successful with the peer, a message "Peer Connected" will be displayed.

	Response : The response of the GET command will be in the following format :

Participants : Prashant Trivedi(Student Id: 200063230),Riwika Roychoudhury(Student ID: 200067986)

Instructions to compile the code :
----------------------------------
1) Extract the src.zip folder which contains all the source files and the makefile.
2) Before running the make command make sure the Java is installed.
3) To compile the code run "make".

Instructions to run the program :
---------------------------------
1) Once the code is compiled, there will be Client.class and the Server.class files which are the Client and Server program.
2) To run the Server, enter "java Server" from the command line. You will be prompted with message "P2P-CI/1.0 system is up".
3) To run the Client enter "java Client" from the command line. It will ask you the following information :
   - Enter the upload port number(>1024) :
	Enter the port number the client will be using to upload any document and it should be greater than 1024.
   - Enter Server address
	Enter the server's IP Address
4) Once the above information is entered, you will get a message "Connected to server". 
5) After successful connection with the server, the following Menu will be displayed :

Menu:
(i)      ADD RFC <RFC Num> P2P-CI/1.0
(ii)     LOOKUP RFC <RFC Num> P2P-CI/1.0
(iii)    LIST ALL P2P-CI/1.0
(iv)     GET RFC <RFC Num> P2P-CI/1.0
(v)      END

6) Below are the details about each command 
- ADD RFC <RFC Num> P2P-CI/1.0 :
	Command to add the RFC to the server list. Enter the ADD command in the specified format.
	It will ask the following information :
	a) Title : <Enter RFC title>
	
	Response : Once the rfc is added to the Server, there will be response like :
	P2P-CI/1.0 200 OK
	RFC <RFCNum> <RFCTitle> <IP of Peer> <UploadPortNum>

- LOOKUP RFC <RFC Num> P2P-CI/1.0
	Command to lookup the RFC in the server list.
	It will ask the following information :
	a) Title : <Enter the RFC Title>

	Response : The result of the lookup will be printed. For Example :
	P2P-CI/1.0 200 OK
	RFC <RFCNum> <RFCTitle> <IP of Peer> <UploadPortNum>
	RFC <RFCNum> <RFCTitle> <IP of Peer> <UploadPortNum>
	RFC <RFCNum> <RFCTitle> <IP of Peer> <UploadPortNum>

- LIST ALL P2P-CI/1.0
	Command to list all rfc's from the server.
	Response : The result of the lookup will be printed. For Example :

	RFC <RFCNum> <RFCTitle> <IP of Peer> <UploadPortNum>
	RFC <RFCNum> <RFCTitle> <IP of Peer> <UploadPortNum>
	RFC <RFCNum> <RFCTitle> <IP of Peer> <UploadPortNum>

- GET RFC <RFC Num> P2P-CI/1.0
	Command to get the RFC from the peer. So before running this command peer will have
	to do lookup for that RFC so that it knows from which peer he wants to download the
	RFC. The following information will be required :
	a) Host : <IP address> - Address of the peer from which it wants to download the RFC.
	b) Port : <Port Num> - Port Number of the peer from which you want to download the RFC.
	Once the connection is successful with the peer, a message "Peer Connected" will be displayed.

	Response : The response of the GET command will be in the following format :
	
	P2P-CI/1.0 200 OK

Instructions to compile the code :
----------------------------------
1) Extract the src.zip folder which contains all the source files and the makefile.
2) Before running the make command make sure the Java is installed.
3) To compile the code run "make".

Instructions to run the program :
---------------------------------
1) Once the code is compiled, there will be Client.class and the Server.class files which are the Client and Server program.
2) To run the Server, enter "java Server" from the command line. You will be prompted with message "P2P-CI/1.0 system is up".
3) To run the Client enter "java Client" from the command line. It will ask you the following information :
   - Enter the upload port number(>1024) :
	Enter the port number the client will be using to upload any document and it should be greater than 1024.
   - Enter Server address

	to do lookup for that RFC so that it knows from which peer he wants to download the
	RFC. The following information will be required :
	a) Host : <IP address> - Address of the peer from which it wants to download the RFC.
	b) Port : <Port Num> - Port Number of the peer from which you want to download the RFC.
	Once the connection is successful with the peer, a message "Peer Connected" will be displayed.

	Response : The response of the GET command will be in the following format :
	
	P2P-CI/1.0 200 OK

Participants : Prashant Trivedi(Student Id: 200063230),Riwika Roychoudhury(Student ID: 200067986)

Instructions to compile the code :
----------------------------------
1) Extract the src.zip folder which contains all the source files and the makefile.
2) Before running the make command make sure the Java is installed.
3) To compile the code run "make".

Instructions to run the program :
---------------------------------
1) Once the code is compiled, there will be Client.class and the Server.class files which are the Client and Server program.
2) To run the Server, enter "java Server" from the command line. You will be prompted with message "P2P-CI/1.0 system is up".
3) To run the Client enter "java Client" from the command line. It will ask you the following information :
   - Enter the upload port number(>1024) :
	Enter the port number the client will be using to upload any document and it should be greater than 1024.
   - Enter Server address
	Enter the server's IP Address
4) Once the above information is entered, you will get a message "Connected to server". 
5) After successful connection with the server, the following Menu will be displayed :

Menu:
(i)      ADD RFC <RFC Num> P2P-CI/1.0
(ii)     LOOKUP RFC <RFC Num> P2P-CI/1.0
(iii)    LIST ALL P2P-CI/1.0
(iv)     GET RFC <RFC Num> P2P-CI/1.0
(v)      END

6) Below are the details about each command 
- ADD RFC <RFC Num> P2P-CI/1.0 :
	Command to add the RFC to the server list. Enter the ADD command in the specified format.
	It will ask the following information :
	a) Title : <Enter RFC title>
	
	Response : Once the rfc is added to the Server, there will be response like :
	P2P-CI/1.0 200 OK
	RFC <RFCNum> <RFCTitle> <IP of Peer> <UploadPortNum>

- LOOKUP RFC <RFC Num> P2P-CI/1.0
	Command to lookup the RFC in the server list.
	It will ask the following information :
	a) Title : <Enter the RFC Title>

	Response : The result of the lookup will be printed. For Example :
	P2P-CI/1.0 200 OK
	RFC <RFCNum> <RFCTitle> <IP of Peer> <UploadPortNum>
	RFC <RFCNum> <RFCTitle> <IP of Peer> <UploadPortNum>
	RFC <RFCNum> <RFCTitle> <IP of Peer> <UploadPortNum>

- LIST ALL P2P-CI/1.0
	Command to list all rfc's from the server.
	Response : The result of the lookup will be printed. For Example :
	P2P-CI/1.0 200 OK
	RFC <RFCNum> <RFCTitle> <IP of Peer> <UploadPortNum>
	RFC <RFCNum> <RFCTitle> <IP of Peer> <UploadPortNum>
